# INSTAGRID

This is an exercice from OpenClassrooms.
Work with the MCV model from apple and develop a responsive application for iOS.

# SPECIFICATIONS

- Users can choose between 3 layouts

- Users can add image from their  folder

- Users can share their work by pan gesture

# INFOS

I tried to use different ways to build Interface :
- CompoView is a subclass of UIview, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate.
- UI variables are created in code but also in storyboard and referenced with @IBOutlet 
- UIPanGestureRecognizer(), UIGraphicsImageRenderer(), UIImagePickerController()
