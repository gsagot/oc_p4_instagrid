Work with the MVC architecture and develop a responsive application for iOS.

# SPECIFICATIONS

# INFOS

I tried to use different ways to build Interface :
- CompoView is a subclass of UIview.
- ViewController is a subclass of UIViewController, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate.
- UI variables are created in code but also in storyboard and referenced with @IBOutlet in ViewController.
- ViewController present UIAlertController, UIActivityController
- UIPanGestureRecognizer(), UIGraphicsImageRenderer(), UIImagePickerController()
